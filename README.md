# pib-eyes
Cute eyes with smooth color transition for pib (see https://github.com/pib-rocks).
The eyes are following the mouse by using its coordinates using the left eye for reference. The eyes will "close" when mouse is pressed.

Width and height of the frame is currently set to 1280 x 720 (16:9) resolution and can easily be changed in the main.py file.
